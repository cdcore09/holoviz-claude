## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Agent vs. Skill Organization
**Decision**: Workflow-based organization with complementary agents

**Why**:
- Users don't think in library terms; they think in workflows
- Panel + Param go together (Specialist agent)
- HoloViews + hvPlot + Colorcet go together (Designer agent)
- Datashader + optimization (Engineer agent)
- GeoViews + spatial (Geo-Spatial agent)

**Result**: Natural task-to-agent mapping

### 2. Skill Grouping Strategy
**Decision**: Thematic organization around user workflows, not 1-to-1 library mapping

**Why**:
- Reduces cognitive load
- Shows how libraries integrate
- Aligns with how users actually work
- Easier to maintain and extend

**Skills Map to Problems**:
- "I'm building a dashboard" → Panel Dashboards skill
- "I need to visualize data quickly" → Plotting Fundamentals skill
- "I need advanced visualizations" → Data Visualization skill
- "I'm working with maps" → Geospatial Visualization skill
- "I have massive data" → Advanced Rendering skill
- "I need to build config UIs" → Parameterization skill
- "Colors aren't working" → Colormaps & Styling skill

### 3. MCP Server Integration
**Decision**: Include holoviz-mcp configuration for real-time access

**Why**:
- Provides access to latest documentation
- Enables dynamic example retrieval
- Allows version-aware recommendations
- Future-proofs the plugin

### 4. Marketplace Positioning
**Decision**: "Expert-level guidance" focused on strategic decision-making

**Why**:
- Not just API documentation
- Teaches "why" not just "how"
- Addresses real-world problems
- Helps with ecosystem navigation
- Production-focused guidance
